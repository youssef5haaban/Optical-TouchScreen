## Overview

Optical TouchScreen is a Bachelor's Graduation Project that focuses on developing a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system for hands-free computing using head and eye tracking. The project integrates mouse and keyboard functions, enabling natural interaction, and proposes an assistive virtual keyboard with predictive typing for individuals with motor disabilities.

## Project Highlights

- **Hands-Free Computing:** Developed an HCI system that enables hands-free computing through head and eye tracking.

- **Integrated Mouse and Keyboard Functions:** The system combines both mouse and keyboard functions, allowing users to interact with the computer using head and eye movements.

- **Assistive Virtual Keyboard:** Proposed an assistive virtual keyboard with predictive typing for individuals with motor disabilities, optimizing typing performance and reducing errors.

## Implementation Details

### Tools Used

- OpenCV
- Fill-Mask
- Tkinter

### Methodology

1. **Head and Eye Tracking:** Implemented real-time head and eye tracking for hands-free computing.

2. **Mouse and Keyboard Integration:** Integrated mouse and keyboard functions based on head and eye movements.

3. **Assistive Virtual Keyboard:** Proposed a virtual keyboard system that utilizes head and eye movements for typing, with predictive typing features.

## Project Report

The project report discusses the development of a novel head and eye control system, emphasizing the importance of hands-free computing for individuals with physical disabilities. The system uses head movements as a computer mouse and employs eye blinking for writing on a virtual keyboard, suggesting words, and moving the cursor. The proposed system uses a simple webcam, providing a convenient and natural interactive mode.

## Usage

1. Explore the implementation details in the project report and code.
2. Understand the system's integration of head and eye tracking, mouse and keyboard functions, and the assistive virtual keyboard.
3. Experiment with the system for hands-free computing and assistive typing.
